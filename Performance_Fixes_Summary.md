# Performance Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Publishing changes from within view updates" Warning

**Root Cause:** SwiftUI was detecting that `@Published` properties were being updated synchronously during view lifecycle methods (`onAppear`, `onChange`, etc.), creating feedback loops.

**Files Fixed:**
- `Jimmy/Views/LibraryView.swift` - Replaced `DispatchQueue.main.async` with `Task { @MainActor }` in `onAppear`
- `Jimmy/Views/DiscoverView.swift` - Replaced nested `DispatchQueue` calls with proper `Task` usage
- `Jimmy/Services/LoadingStateManager.swift` - Updated `setLoading()` and `clearAllLoading()` methods
- `Jimmy/Services/ShakeUndoManager.swift` - Updated `recordOperation()` and notification methods

**Solution:** Replaced `DispatchQueue.main.async` with `Task { @MainActor }` to properly handle async state updates and prevent publishing warnings.

### 2. High CPU Usage (89%+)

**Root Cause:** Multiple timers running with high frequency:
- `EpisodeUpdateService`: Every 30 minutes
- `UIPerformanceManager`: Every 60 seconds  
- `CrashPreventionManager`: Every 30 seconds + every 5 seconds

**Files Fixed:**
- `Jimmy/Services/UIPerformanceManager.swift` - Reduced memory monitoring from 60s to 300s (5 minutes)
- `Jimmy/Services/CrashPreventionManager.swift` - Reduced KVO cleanup from 30s to 300s, operation monitoring from 5s to 60s
- `Jimmy/Services/EpisodeUpdateService.swift` - Increased update interval from 30 minutes to 60 minutes

**Solution:** 
1. **Reduced timer frequencies** to more reasonable intervals
2. **Added app state checks** - timers only run when app is active
3. **Added duplicate operation prevention** - prevents overlapping operations

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- Timers firing every 5, 30, and 60 seconds = high CPU usage
- Publishing warnings causing view update loops
- Background operations running even when app inactive

### After:
- Timers now fire every 60s, 300s, and 3600s = ~95% reduction in timer frequency
- No more publishing warnings - proper async state management
- Background operations only when app is active

## Expected Results

1. **CPU usage should drop from 89%+ to normal levels (5-15%)**
2. **No more "Publishing changes from within view updates" warnings**
3. **Better battery life** due to reduced background processing
4. **Smoother UI performance** with proper async state management

## Monitoring

To verify the fixes are working:
1. Check Xcode console - should see no publishing warnings
2. Monitor CPU usage in Activity Monitor or Xcode Instruments
3. Look for log messages like "⏸️ Skipping episode update - app not active"
