# ðŸŽ§ Apple Podcasts Bulk Import for Jimmy

## The One-Button Solution You Asked For!

Instead of importing only 7 podcasts, you can now get **ALL** your Apple Podcasts subscriptions into Jimmy with this two-step process:

### Step 1: Extract Your Subscriptions
1. Open the file `Jimmy/Utilities/apple-podcasts-extractor.html` in your web browser
2. Follow the simple 4-step wizard to extract all your Apple Podcasts subscriptions
3. This creates a JSON file with all your podcast RSS feeds

### Step 2: Import into Jimmy
1. Open Jimmy app on your iPhone
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Import from File (Bulk)**
3. Select the JSON file you downloaded from Step 1
4. **Done!** All your podcasts are now in Jimmy

## How It Works

The web extractor:
- âœ… Accesses Apple Podcasts web interface
- âœ… Scrolls through your entire subscription library
- âœ… Extracts podcast information and converts Apple URLs to RSS feeds
- âœ… Downloads a complete import file with ALL your subscriptions
- âœ… Works with hundreds of subscriptions

## Why This Method?

- **Complete**: Gets ALL your subscriptions, not just downloaded episodes
- **Fast**: One-time extraction, then instant import
- **Reliable**: Uses Apple's own iTunes API for RSS conversion
- **Privacy**: Everything runs in your browser, no data sent anywhere

## Technical Details

The extractor uses:
1. JavaScript to scan the Apple Podcasts web interface
2. iTunes Search API to convert Apple Podcast URLs to RSS feeds
3. JSON export format that Jimmy can import directly

This bypasses the iOS MediaPlayer framework limitations that only find downloaded episodes.
