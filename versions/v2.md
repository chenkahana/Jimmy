# Version 2 - Stability Improvements

This release focuses entirely on making Jimmy more reliable. The goal is to fix edge cases, prevent crashes, and ensure data integrity across updates.

## Stability Tasks

- **Move lock-screen widget files into a proper extension target** so the main app and widget build cleanly and can't interfere with each other.
- **Configure App Groups** to guarantee safe data sharing between the widget and app.
- **Expand unit test coverage** for services, view models, and the caching system.
- **Add UI tests** for queue management, playback, and import flows.
- **Set up Continuous Integration** to run all tests on every commit.
- **Improve network error handling** with retries and clear offline fallbacks.
- **Add crash and error logging** using OSLog with exported log files for diagnostics.
- **Profile memory usage** and fix any leaks or retain cycles discovered with Instruments.
- **Strengthen file-based storage** with corruption checks and automatic recovery.
- **Ensure caching falls back gracefully** when disk space is low or data is missing.
- **Verify data migrations** from version 1 so updates never lose user data.
- **Document troubleshooting steps** in the README for end users and testers.
