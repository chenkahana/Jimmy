# Jimmy ðŸŽ™

**Built by AI, guided by Human** ðŸ¤–ðŸ§­

Jimmy is an iOS podcast player created entirely by artificial intelligence. Every line of code you see here was produced by AI, with humans only guiding the direction. The goal is a lightweight, queueâ€‘centric app that is playful yet polished.

## Purpose
Jimmy keeps your listening queue front and center so you can quickly line up episodes, listen offline and pick up where you left off without digging through complicated menus.

## Motivation
This project explores how far AI can go in building a real, userâ€‘facing application. Jimmy aims to show that an AIâ€‘generated codebase can still feel thoughtful and professional, providing a smooth experience for podcast fans.

## Technology
- **Swift 5.9** and **SwiftUI** for the entire interface
- **Combine** for async data flows
- **AVFoundation** for audio playback
