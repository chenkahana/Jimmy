# Performance Optimization Plan for Jimmy

## Current State Analysis

The Jimmy app already includes several significant optimizations that provide a solid foundation for performance:

### Existing Optimizations

- **Comprehensive Caching System**: ImageCache manages both memory and disk caches with configurable limits
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Episode caching uses concurrent queues and file-based persistence
- **Background Processing**: Episode data operations are delegated to background queues to prevent UI blocking
- **Network Resilience**: NetworkManager supports retries for network requests
- **Timed Updates**: PodcastDataManager implements 30-minute refresh intervals
- **Audio Preloading**: AudioPlayerService preloads up to three queued episodes for fast starts

### Cache Configuration
- Memory Cache: 50 MB limit
- Disk Cache: 200 MB limit
- Concurrent download management via CacheConfig

## Performance Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Background Task Optimization

#### 1.1 Implement BGTaskScheduler for Background Refresh âœ… COMPLETED
**Priority**: High  
**Current Issue**: PodcastDataManager relies on Timer for periodic refreshes  
**Solution**: Replace Timer-based refresh with BGAppRefreshTask
- Enable prefetching of episodes and artwork when iOS determines optimal timing
- Keep UI free of refresh delays
- Allow updates while app is suspended
- **Reference**: `setupAutoRefresh()` method using Timer

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**:
- Created `BackgroundTaskManager` class to handle BGTaskScheduler operations
- Added background-processing capability to Info.plist with task identifier
- Updated `PodcastDataManager` to remove Timer-based refresh
- Integrated background task scheduling in `JimmyApp.swift`
- Added debug view for testing background refresh functionality
- Background tasks are scheduled when app enters background and run concurrently

### Phase 2: Network Optimization

#### 2.1 HTTP Caching with Conditional Requests
**Priority**: High  
**Target**: PodcastService and ImageCache network requests  
**Implementation**:
- Add ETag support to NetworkManager.fetchData
- Implement Last-Modified header handling
- Minimize network traffic for unchanged content
- Speed up reload operations

#### 2.2 Unified URLSession Configuration
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current Issue**: NetworkManager uses shared URLSession  
**Solution**:
- Create dedicated URLSession with optimized caching policies
- Reduce connection overhead for simultaneous downloads
- Improve performance for bulk image/feed downloads

### Phase 3: Dynamic Resource Management

#### 3.1 Adaptive Cache Sizing
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current Issue**: Fixed cache limits (50 MB memory, 200 MB disk)  
**Solution**:
- Implement dynamic cache limits based on available device resources
- Prevent memory pressure on lower-end devices
- Maximize cache efficiency on newer models with more resources

#### 3.2 Asynchronous Disk Operations
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current Issue**: Synchronous disk access in image caching (TODO comment noted)  
**Solution**:
- Implement async disk checks for cached images
- Reduce UI thread blocking during scrolling
- Improve prefetching performance
- **Reference**: TODO comment in `isImageCached`

### Phase 4: Intelligent Content Management

#### 4.1 Predictive Episode Prefetching
**Priority**: Medium  
**Enhancement**: Extend existing AudioPlayerService preloading  
**Implementation**:
- Track user listening patterns (time of day, preferred shows)
- Preload episodes based on historical usage
- Reduce wait times for frequent listeners

#### 4.2 Optimize Episode Data Persistence
**Priority**: Medium  
**Current Issue**: Multiple asynchronous queue updates for episodes  
**Solution**:
- Implement batched writes using DispatchWorkItem
- Consider dedicated persistence layer (Core Data)
- Reduce file system churn for large episode queues

### Phase 5: UI Performance Optimization

#### 5.1 View Hierarchy Optimization
**Priority**: Medium  
**Target**: EpisodeRowView and LazyVStack implementation  
**Focus Areas**:
- Profile custom gradients, overlays, and animations
- Ensure proper cell reuse in LazyVStack
- Minimize expensive view modifiers
- Maintain smooth scrolling performance

### Phase 6: Monitoring and Maintenance

#### 6.1 Performance Instrumentation
**Priority**: Low  
**Implementation**: OSLog signposts for performance monitoring  
**Target Operations**:
- Feed parsing in PodcastService.fetchEpisodes
- Cache lookup operations
- Audio loading processes
- Real-time bottleneck identification in production

#### 6.2 Storage Management
**Priority**: Low  
**Current Status**: File-based storage implemented to resolve UserDefaults limits  
**Enhancements**:
- Implement periodic cleanup of old episodes and caches
- Add user-configurable cache limits
- Automatic purging of played content
- Prevent excessive disk usage growth

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
- [x] BGTaskScheduler implementation - **COMPLETED**: Replaced Timer-based refresh with BGTaskScheduler
- [ ] HTTP caching with ETag support

### Short Term (1-2 Months)
- [ ] Adaptive cache sizing
- [ ] Asynchronous disk operations
- [ ] Unified URLSession configuration

### Medium Term (2-4 Months)
- [ ] Predictive episode prefetching
- [ ] Episode data persistence optimization
- [ ] View hierarchy optimization

### Long Term (4+ Months)
- [ ] Performance instrumentation with OSLog
- [ ] Advanced storage management features

## Success Metrics

- **App Launch Time**: Target 50% reduction in cold start time
- **Memory Usage**: Adaptive memory usage based on device capabilities
- **Network Efficiency**: Reduce redundant network requests by 60%
- **User Experience**: Eliminate UI blocking during background operations
- **Battery Life**: Optimize background tasks to minimize battery drain

## Notes

This plan builds upon the existing asynchronous infrastructure and caching system. The focus is on reducing latency, better managing resources across various devices, and ensuring background tasks don't impact the foreground user experience.
